# Fill
A Bukkit/Spigot plugin for Minecraft servers used for filling container blocks very rapidly.

### Usage (basic)
* Hold the item in your hand that you want to fill every slot with
* Type `/fill`
* Right click the container blocks with the new "fill-wand" you just created
* Enjoy!

### Usage (advanced)
* Type `/fill <item-id> <quantity> <data>` to get a "fill-wand" with the specific attributes specified in the command
* Right click the container blocks with the new "fill-wand" you received
* Enjoy!

### Important things to know
* The sound and message that occurs when clicking the container block with the fill wand can be disabled in the config
* The wand is enabled on a per-world basis in the config, so if you want it to work in non-default worlds please check it
* There is a permission for the command, and it is `fill.command`, and it defaults to OPs only
